This folder contains all files regarding epidemic spread and mapping.


Some abstract steps for tracking spread:

1. Imagine the area divided in a grid of 3 X 3 (like a tic tac toe grid)

2. Now suppose the centre tile if affected so this make all surrounding 8 tiles probable to be affected.

3. Now we know these 9 tiles are to be focussed rather than anywhere else.

4. Now using data sources from hospitals and apis like OpenWeather and google weather(past historic data) we can narrow down area.

5. Supoose expected wind direction is North-East this makes tiles 2,3 and 6 more severe than others.

6. Using other parameters like heat mapping of town and other algortihms we can predict and map the spread on real time basis.
